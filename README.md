Changelog:

+Made variables private
+Cleaned up variables and constructor
+Finished converting GamePlay into methods and organised them more
+Created a GamePlay object in the RunCommandLine class and made it run the game with playGame() method
+No obvious bugs
-playGame() needs a loop to go back to the start of the game on finishing, suspect the variable will be a boolean type
